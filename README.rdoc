== What is Klaviyo?

Klaviyo is a real-time service for understanding your customers by aggregating all your customer data, identifying important groups of customers and then taking action.

== What does this Gem do?

* Track customers and events directly from your backend.
* Track customers and events via JavaScript using a Rack middleware.


== How to install?

  gem install klaviyo


== How to use it with a Rails application?

To automatically insert the Klaviyo script in your Rails app, add this to your environment config file or create a new initializer for it:

  config.middleware.use "Klaviyo::Client::Middleware", "YOUR_KLAVIYO_API_TOKEN"

This will automatically insert the Klaviyo script at the bottom on your HTML page, right before the closing <code>body</code> tag.

To record customer actions directly from your backend, in your <code>application_controller</code> class add a method to initialize Klaviyo.

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    before_filter :initialize_klaviyo

    def initialize_klaviyo
      @klaviyo = Klaviyo::Client.new("YOUR_KLAVIYO_API_TOKEN")
    end
  end

Then in your controllers where you'd like to record an event:

  @klaviyo.track('Did something important', :email => 'john.smith@example.com', :properties => {:key => 'value'})
